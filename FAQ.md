# Presso – Frequently Asked Questions

A quick guide to how Presso works, what it needs, and answers to common questions from staff and students.

---

## **Basic Functionality**

### **How does Presso work?**
A professor starts a 90-second (customizable) attendance session. Students within range tap once to mark themselves present. Location ensures accuracy.

### **What does Presso need to work?**
A smartphone with GPS enabled and basic internet access. No additional hardware or setup is required.

### **Does Presso work offline?**
Presso requires internet access for syncing attendance data between students and professors.  
We’re working on a feature where the app will show the last available synced data when offline, and automatically update once internet is restored.

## **For Professors**

### **Can professors manually mark attendance?**
Yes — professors can override and mark students present/absent manually if needed.

### **How is attendance exported or saved?**
Attendance records can be exported as a CSV file with one tap. The app also maintains real-time summaries.

### **Can the attendance window be changed from 90 seconds?**
Yes. While the default is 90 seconds, this duration can be customized anytime based on your classroom needs.

## **For Students**

### **Do students need to log in?**
No. Students are marked present only if they’re within 50 meters of the professor’s location.  
This distance limit is fully customizable based on your institute’s policy or classroom layout.

### **Can students mark attendance from home or far away?**
No. Students are marked present only if they’re within 50 meters of the professor’s location.

### **Can students see their attendance report?**
Yes. Students can check their attendance report anytime.  
On a given day, they can refresh and track their live status (P/A) per subject.  
Additionally, they can view:
- Total classes attended
- Total present days
- Overall percentage
- Subject-wise total, presents, and percentage

## **Setup / Admin**

### **Is it difficult to set up?**
No. Presso is plug-and-play. No biometric hardware, no separate servers — just install and start using.

### **What about privacy?**
Location is only used at the moment of marking attendance. No continuous tracking is done.

### **Can this scale to an entire department or college?**
Yes. We offer per-department customization and can onboard multiple classes.

## **Other Common Questions**

### **Is this available on iOS?**
Currently, Presso is Android-only. iOS version is under consideration based on demand.

### **What happens if a student’s GPS is inaccurate or slow?**
The app provides fallback options including manual override by the professor.

### **Is this a biometric system or proxy solution?**
No. This is not a biometric system. Presso is designed to prevent proxy and streamline attendance without physical infrastructure.
