# Presso – Plug-and-Play Attendance for Colleges

**No Hardware. No Setup. Just Instant Attendance.**  
Presso is a lightweight Android app designed to modernize classroom attendance.  
Professors start attendance with a tap. Students within range mark themselves present.  
No biometric devices, no messy spreadsheets — just **location + time-based logic**, built for speed and accuracy.
